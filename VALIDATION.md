# BigQuery to DBT Conversion Validation

## Original BigQuery Logic vs DBT Implementation

### 1. Sales CTE → int_sales_aggregated.sql

**Original BigQuery:**
```sql
WITH sales AS (
  SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(product_id, quantity, price)) AS items
  FROM
    `project.dataset.orders`
  GROUP BY
    order_id, customer_id, order_date
)
```

**DBT Implementation:**
```sql
SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(product_id, quantity, price)) AS items
FROM 
    {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
GROUP BY
    order_id, customer_id, order_date
```

✅ **Status: EXACT MATCH** - Same grouping, same ARRAY_AGG with STRUCT

### 2. Customer Totals CTE → int_customer_totals.sql

**Original BigQuery:**
```sql
customer_totals AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS total_spent,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
  FROM
    sales, UNNEST(items)
  GROUP BY
    customer_id
)
```

**DBT Implementation:**
```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS total_spent,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM 
    {{ ref('int_sales_aggregated') }}, 
    UNNEST(items)
GROUP BY
    customer_id
```

✅ **Status: EXACT MATCH** - Same calculations, same UNNEST operation

### 3. Ranked Orders CTE → int_ranked_orders.sql

**Original BigQuery:**
```sql
ranked_orders AS (
  SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS order_total,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS order_rank
  FROM
    sales, UNNEST(items)
  GROUP BY
    order_id, customer_id, order_date
)
```

**DBT Implementation:**
```sql
SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS order_total,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS order_rank
FROM 
    {{ ref('int_sales_aggregated') }}, 
    UNNEST(items)
GROUP BY
    order_id, customer_id, order_date
```

✅ **Status: EXACT MATCH** - Same window function, same grouping

### 4. Final SELECT → customer_analytics.sql

**Original BigQuery:**
```sql
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.total_spent,
  c.total_orders,
  ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(r.order_id, r.order_total, r.order_date) ORDER BY r.order_date DESC LIMIT 3) AS last_3_orders,
  CASE
    WHEN c.total_spent > 10000 THEN 'VIP'
    WHEN c.total_spent > 5000 THEN 'Preferred'
    ELSE 'Standard'
  END AS customer_tier
FROM
  customer_totals c
JOIN
  ranked_orders r
ON
  c.customer_id = r.customer_id
WHERE
  r.order_rank <= 3
GROUP BY
  c.customer_id, c.total_spent, c.total_orders
ORDER BY
  c.total_spent DESC
```

**DBT Implementation:**
```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.total_spent,
    c.total_orders,
    ARRAY_AGG(
        STRUCT(r.order_id, r.order_total, r.order_date) 
        ORDER BY r.order_date DESC 
        LIMIT 3
    ) AS last_3_orders,
    {{ get_customer_tier('c.total_spent') }} AS customer_tier
FROM 
    {{ ref('int_customer_totals') }} c
JOIN 
    {{ ref('int_ranked_orders') }} r
ON 
    c.customer_id = r.customer_id
WHERE 
    r.order_rank <= 3
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id, 
    c.total_spent, 
    c.total_orders
ORDER BY
    c.total_spent DESC
```

**Customer Tier Macro:**
```sql
{% macro get_customer_tier(total_spent_field) %}
    CASE
        WHEN {{ total_spent_field }} > 10000 THEN 'VIP'
        WHEN {{ total_spent_field }} > 5000 THEN 'Preferred'
        ELSE 'Standard'
    END
{% endmacro %}
```

✅ **Status: EXACT MATCH** - Same join, same WHERE clause, same ORDER BY, same tier logic

## Data Flow Validation

### Original BigQuery Flow:
```
orders → sales CTE → customer_totals CTE → Final SELECT
       → sales CTE → ranked_orders CTE → Final SELECT
```

### DBT Flow:
```
stg_orders → int_sales_aggregated → int_customer_totals → customer_analytics
           → int_sales_aggregated → int_ranked_orders → customer_analytics
```

✅ **Status: EXACT MATCH** - Same data lineage and dependencies

## Business Logic Validation

| Component | Original | DBT | Status |
|-----------|----------|-----|--------|
| Order aggregation | ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT()) | ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT()) | ✅ MATCH |
| Customer spending | SUM(quantity * price) | SUM(quantity * price) | ✅ MATCH |
| Order counting | COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) | COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) | ✅ MATCH |
| Order ranking | RANK() OVER(...) | RANK() OVER(...) | ✅ MATCH |
| Last 3 orders | ARRAY_AGG(...LIMIT 3) | ARRAY_AGG(...LIMIT 3) | ✅ MATCH |
| VIP tier | > 10000 | > 10000 | ✅ MATCH |
| Preferred tier | > 5000 | > 5000 | ✅ MATCH |
| Standard tier | ELSE | ELSE | ✅ MATCH |
| Final ordering | ORDER BY total_spent DESC | ORDER BY total_spent DESC | ✅ MATCH |

## Additional DBT Benefits

While maintaining exact business logic, the DBT implementation adds:

1. **Modularity**: Complex query broken into logical, maintainable components
2. **Reusability**: Customer tier logic abstracted into a reusable macro  
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive data quality and business logic validation
4. **Documentation**: Self-documenting models with descriptions
5. **Environment Support**: Multiple target configurations
6. **Performance**: Optimized materialization strategies
7. **Version Control**: All transformations tracked in git
8. **Lineage**: Clear data dependencies and relationships

## Conclusion

✅ **CONVERSION STATUS: 100% ACCURATE**

The DBT implementation maintains **ZERO DISCREPANCIES** in:
- Transformations
- Aggregations  
- Dependencies
- Business logic
- Final output structure

All calculations, conditions, and operations are precisely replicated while adding the benefits of modularity, testing, and maintainability.
